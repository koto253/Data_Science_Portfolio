I use data science to uncover insights, answer questions, and share knowledge to help others improve their lives. 
My work involves building and improving data pipelines, cleaning and preparing datasets, and developing machine learning models to solve real-world problems. 
I’m constantly working on new projects and refining existing ones, aiming to enhance model performance and extract actionable insights.
By exploring data trends and patterns, I strive to provide meaningful answers and create tools that empower others. 
Whether it’s through dashboards, visualizations, or teaching others based on my findings, my goal is to make data science accessible and impactful. 
Stay tuned for updates as I continue to grow and share my journey in data science!
